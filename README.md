# AWS-Lambda-with-GeoServer
### *Abstract*
*This project deals with the design and development of a serverless application to interpolate spatial data. In a context of precision agriculture, a system equipped with Arduino is programmed to detect the presence of insects in an area. Through the use of adhesive traps and computer vision algorithms, the trapped insects are counted with the vision system and the result is uploaded to the cloud for further processing. The application, therefore, receives as input a dataset containing information on the geographical coordinates of the traps (latitude and longitude) and, for each trap, the number of insects present. Subsequently, the data are interpolated by an algorithm and, after processing, the result is uploaded to a server. The application, specifically, consists of two Lambda Function deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The dataset to be interpolated is sent via HTTP request to the web application, which, after execution, interfaces automatically with GeoServer, an open source tool for viewing and editing geospatial data. Finally, GeoServer proceeds to apply a color gradient to the result, producing a heatmap.*
